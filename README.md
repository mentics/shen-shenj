# shen-shenj

This is an old project I made to compile Shen Lisp to JVM bytecode.

Generally, the code here is released under the Apache license except anything required under the Shen license: http://www.shenlanguage.org/ . The files under kl are copied from, owned and licensed under the Shen license.

This uses the Kryo library: https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryo
